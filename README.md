# PigPlayer

This project creates a dice game. The way the game works is if you roll a 1 then you get 0 points for that turn and it is the next player's turn. For any other roll you have a choice, either hold and secure the points that you have accumulated on your current turn or roll again and risk rolling a 1 which would lose it all. FourTurnsPlayer, SimpleHoldPlayer, and StrategicPlayer implement different playing styles for the computer.
